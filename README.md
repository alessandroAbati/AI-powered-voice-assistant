AI-Powered Voice Assistant
This repository contains code for an AI-powered voice assistant that can interact with users, provide information, and assist with tasks. The project is based on the excellent work of the Bing-GPT-Voice-Assistant repository by Ai-Austin, which served as the foundation for this project. It has been extended to include additional features and capabilities.

Features
Wake Words: The voice assistant responds to the wake words "ok bing" or "ok chat."

Chat Interaction: With the wake word recognized, users can engage in a conversation with the voice assistant. It uses GPT-3 to provide context-aware responses.

Precise Response: For certain scenarios, the voice assistant utilizes a precise conversation style when interacting with the user.

Speech Synthesis: Responses from the voice assistant are synthesized using Amazon Polly, providing a natural and human-like voice.

Requirements
To use this voice assistant, you need to fulfill the following requirements:

OpenAI API Key: You must have an OpenAI API key to enable the GPT-3 chat capabilities. Get your API key by visiting the OpenAI website.

AWS Account and Polly Access: The voice synthesis feature is powered by Amazon Polly. You need an AWS account and API credentials for Polly to use this feature.

Getting Started
Using Conda (Recommended)
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/alessandroAbati/AI-powered-voice-assistant.git
cd AI-powered-voice-assistant
Set up a virtual environment with Conda using the provided environment.yml file:

bash
Copy code
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate voice-assistant-env
Replace [paste your OpenAI API key here] in main.py with your actual OpenAI API key.

Run the voice assistant:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Using Pip
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/AI-powered-voice-assistant.git
cd AI-powered-voice-assistant
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .\venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Replace [paste your OpenAI API key here] in main.py with your actual OpenAI API key.

Run the voice assistant:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Usage
Start the voice assistant by running main.py.

Wait for the wake word ("ok bing" or "ok chat") and speak your prompt.

The voice assistant will respond based on the prompt using either GPT-3 or a precise conversation style.

Enjoy the interactions with your AI-powered voice assistant!

Important Note
This voice assistant uses AI technologies and requires proper API keys. It's essential to keep your API keys and credentials secure and follow the usage guidelines of the respective services.

Next Steps / Future Improvements
Here are some potential areas for enhancement and development:

Customization: Allow users to customize the wake words, conversation style, or add new capabilities to the voice assistant.

Additional APIs: Integrate other APIs for more functionalities, such as weather information, news updates, or language translation.

Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle API errors or unexpected user input.

Optimization: Optimize the code for efficiency and performance, especially when interacting with external APIs.

User Interface: Create a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the voice assistant more user-friendly.

Continuous Learning: Explore methods to make the voice assistant learn from user interactions and improve over time.

Community Contributions: Encourage others to contribute to the project by adding new features, fixing bugs, or improving documentation.

Feel free to contribute to this project by addressing any of the above points or by suggesting your own ideas!
